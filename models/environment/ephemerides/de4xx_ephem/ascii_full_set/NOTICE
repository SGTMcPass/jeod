This directory contains the ascii JPL ephemeris data files but is not provided 
for open-source. The JEOD build rules as of JEOD v5.0.1 to v5.2.0 does not 
account for the possibility of having the generated source files but not these 
ascii files. Only the names of the files were required so this directory has 
empty versions of the ascii files so that the *.cc files get built. JEOD v5.3.0 
will have a fix for this.
