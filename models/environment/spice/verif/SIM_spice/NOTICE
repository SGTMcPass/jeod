To run SIM_spice, the kernel files are needed. The files used for testing can be accessed by unzipping jeod_ephemdata.zip. Alternatively, they are available to be downloaded on the NAIF website. Refer to data/kernels*.tm in this directory to identify the required files to run SIM_spice.

The NAIF directory structure may change in the future, but the files required for SIM_spice are located in the following directories as of February 2025.
*Note that pck/earth_000101_******_******.bpc is automatically updated on NAIFs website and has small differences over time, so to perfectly match the regression data, use the kernal files in regression.zip.
